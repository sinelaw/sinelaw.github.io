<p>I spend too much time in traffic.</p>

<p>So much time, that I start to see things. I see patterns.</p>

<p>You can get stuck in a slow lane because the others are going so fast you never manage to merge. So on average, how much time do you spend stuck in unescapable lanes? Does it make a difference in the cosmic scheme? (No, it doesnâ€™t)</p>

<p>I decided to build a simulator and see how driving styles affect traffic.</p>
