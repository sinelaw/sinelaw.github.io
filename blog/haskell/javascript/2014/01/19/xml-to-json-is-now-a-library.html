<p>A while back I needed to convert a ton (millions) of small xml files to json, so I could store them in <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a>. To that end I wrote a teensy-tiny tool called xml-to-json (<a href="https://github.com/sinelaw/xml-to-json">github</a>, <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xml-to-json">Hackage</a>). Originally it was just a command-line tool with all the code thrown in a single file.</p>

<p>So, I did a quick refactor this week to split it into a library + executable, and pushed it to github (to deafening cries of joy).</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>First, a non-feature. xml-to-json is “optimized” for many small xml files. If you have many small xml files, you can easily take advantage of multiple cores / cpu’s. You should be aware that for large files (over 10MB of xml data in a single file) something starts to eat up RAM, around 50 times the size of the file.</p>

<p>Other features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can filter xml subtrees to convert, by element name regex (and you can skip the matching tree root if you wish, converting only the child elements and down).</li>
  <li>Output either a top-level json object or json array.</li>
  <li>(Optionally) simplify representation of xml text nodes in attribute-less elements (e.g. “<elem>test</elem>” -&gt; { elem: “test” })</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="packages-used">Packages used</h2>

<p>For XML decoding, I’m using <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hxt">hxt</a> (over <a href="http://expat.sourceforge.net/">expat</a> using <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hxt-expat">hxt-expat</a>). I tried a few of the xml packages on hackage, and hxt + expat was the only way I could parse quickly while avoiding <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2292729/with-haskell-how-do-i-process-large-volumes-of-xml">nasty memory issues</a>. Apparently, tagsoup can be used with Bytestrings to avoid the same issue but I didn’t try.<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2292729/with-haskell-how-do-i-process-large-volumes-of-xml"></a></p>

<p>JSON is encoded using <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson">aeson.</a></p>
