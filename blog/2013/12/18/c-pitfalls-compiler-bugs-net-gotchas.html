<p>Rarely, but not rarely enough, I find myself banging my head against some unexpected semantics of the C# language. Sometimes I’m simply misunderstanding the language, other times it’s a limitation, or even a compiler bug.</p>

<p>To document my findings I’ve started <a href="https://github.com/bdb-opensource/c-sharp-pitfalls">repository on github</a> for a list of C# pitfalls, compiler bugs, and various other .NET framework gotchas. These are not “beginner tips” - they are things that may surprise a seasoned developer (or is it just me?).</p>

<p>In any case, all are welcome to join this effort - don’t hesitate to fork &amp; send your pull requests.</p>
