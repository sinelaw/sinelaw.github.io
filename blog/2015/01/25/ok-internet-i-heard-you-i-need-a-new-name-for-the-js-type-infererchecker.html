<p>I knew a new name is needed for <a href="https://noamlewis.wordpress.com/2015/01/20/introducing-sjs-a-type-inferer-and-checker-for-javascript/">this JS type inferer/checker</a>. Many people have pointed out that sweet.js uses the same short name (sjs). I could just stick with “Safe JS” but not make it short. Or I could pick a new name, to make it less boring.</p>

<p>Help me help you!</p>

<p><strong>Please take <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/bOEIZmFUUn">this quick poll</a>.</strong></p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
