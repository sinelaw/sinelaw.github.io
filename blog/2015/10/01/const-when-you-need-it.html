<p><em>infernu uses row-type polymorphism to propagate read/write capabilities on record fields. Using row-type polymorphism to describe more than just which fields are present bears a vague resemblance to polymorphic constraints.</em></p>

<p>In C, a pointer to a field in a const struct is automatically const’ed:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>struct foo { int field; };

void useInt(const int *);

int main(void) {

    const struct foo x;

    useInt(&amp;x.field); // no warnings because &amp;x.field is 'const int *'

    return 0;
}

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Thus, a function that extracts a pointer to a (possibly deep) field from a const struct, will also return a const pointer:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>const int *getField(const struct foo *x) {

    return &amp;x-&gt;field;

}

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(All the code compiles with `-Wall` and `-Wextra`)</p>

<p>But, what if I want to use `getField` on a non-const struct, to get an accessor to a field within it? Almost works:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>struct foo y;
int *bla = getField(&amp;y);
*bla = 2;

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Uh oh. We get a warning:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>warning: initialization discards ‘const’ qualifier 
from pointer target type [enabled by default]
     int *bla = getField(&amp;y);
                ^

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The compiler is angry because `int *bla` should be `<strong>const</strong> int *bla`. But we don’t want that! We just want to get an accessor - a writable accessor - to a field in our not-const struct value.</p>

<p>C++ (not C) does have a non-solution: <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/const_cast">const_cast</a>. That isn’t what we want: it’s unsafe. What we want is, if a <strong>function doesn’t get a const struct</strong>, the ‘non-constness’ should propagate to the field accessor being returned (and vice versa: if the given struct was const, so should the accessor).</p>

<p>In fancier words, we need <strong>const polymorphism</strong>, which I imagine would be written with a ‘constness type variable’ <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C</code> like this made-up syntax:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>const&lt;C&gt; int *getField(const&lt;C&gt; struct foo *x) {
    return &amp;x-&gt;field;
}

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then we would expect this to compile with no problems:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    struct foo y;
    int *bla = getField(&amp;y);

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>…because, as ‘y’ is not const, ergo the pointer returned from getField is not pointing at a const.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, no such thing. We could represent this in a type system in a number of ways. One simple way is to say that constness is a constraint on a type (using something like Haskell’s type classes). Another way is to have ‘write into a field’ be a kind of a capability that’s part of the type.</p>

<p>The latter, write-capability approach is what I use in <a href="http://sinelaw.github.io/infernu.org/s/">Infernu</a>. Here there are no structs (it’s JavaScript) but there are polymorphic records. The type system includes two flavors for each field label: Get and Set. If a field is only being read, the record (or object or row) that contains it only needs to have the ‘Get’ accessor for that field. Here’s infernu’s output for a simple example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>//  obj :  { subObj:  { val: Number } }
var obj = { subObj: { val: 3 } };

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Our object is simple. The comment is what infernu infers, a reasonably simple type.</p>

<p>In the notation I (shamelessly) invented, read-only fields have a prefix ‘get’ in the type, and read/write fields don’t have any prefix. So a read-only field ‘bla’ would be: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{ get bla : t }</code>. If ‘bla’ is required to be writable, the type is written as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{ bla : t }</code>. So in the above ‘obj’ example, we see that literal objects are by default inferred to be writable (type annotations would allow you to control that).</p>

<p>Next let’s make a function that only reads ‘subObj’:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>//       readSubObj : ( { get subObj: h | g} -&gt; h)
function readSubObj(x) { return x.subObj; }

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The type inferred says “readSubObj is a function, that takes an object with a <strong>readable field subObj</strong>, (hence “get subObj”: it doesn’t require the ‘Set’ capability!). subObj has any type ‘h’, and the function returns that same type, ‘h’. (By the way, that ‘<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">| g</code>’ means the passed object is allowed to contain also other fields, we don’t care.)</p>

<p>Example of a nested read:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>//       readVal : ( { get subObj:  { get val: d | c} | b} -&gt; d)
function readVal(x) { return x.subObj.val; }

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we need to ‘get subObj’ but subObj itself is an object with a readable field ‘val’ of type d. The function returns a ‘d’.</p>

<p>We can use readSubObj on a writable object with no problems:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>//  sub :  { val: Number }
var sub = readSubObj(obj);

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When infernu supports type annotations (eventually) one could take advantage of this type-system feature by marking certain fields ‘get’.</p>

<p>While this isn’t exactly the same as the problem we discussed with C const pointers, the same idea <em>could</em> be used to implement polymorphic constness.</p>

<p>The main idea here is that ideas from row-type polymorphism can be used to implement a certain kind of ‘capabilities’ over types, constraints that are propagated. This may be a nicer way to implement (some kind of) <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12718268/polymorphic-constraint">polymorphic constraints</a>.</p>

<p>(For example, in a language that supports row extension/reduction, a function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{ x : Int | r } -&gt; { | r }</code> would retain the unspecified constraints from ‘r’. I’m sure there are more interesting examples.)</p>

<p>If you can refer me to something like this, please do!</p>
