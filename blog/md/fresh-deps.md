# The Open-Source Libraries Powering Fresh

Building [Fresh](https://sinelaw.github.io/fresh/) would have been insanely hard if it weren't for these libraries.

Packages specifically useful for building a TUI text editor:

| Crate | One-Line Summary |
| :--- | :--- |
| [arboard](https://crates.io/crates/arboard) | Cross-platform acesss to the system clipboard (CTRL+C for the win) |
| [crossterm](https://crates.io/crates/crossterm) | Terminal manipulation, handling input, cursor movement, and colors across platforms (backend for ratatui) |
| [deno](https://crates.io/crates/deno_ast) | TypeScript/JavaScript embeddeble runtime, used for the plugin system (`deno_ast`, `deno_core`, etc.) |
| [dirs](https://crates.io/crates/dirs) | Abstracting away platform-specific user directories (like desktop, documents, cache) |
| [ignore](https://crates.io/crates/ignore) | Pattern matching for files, often using `.gitignore` syntax |
| [lsp-types](https://crates.io/crates/lsp-types) | Data structures corresponding to the types defined by the Language Server Protocol (LSP) |
| [notify](https://crates.io/crates/notify) | Cross-platform filesystem event monitor/watcher for detecting file system changes (for detecting changes and auto-reverting buffers) |
| [pulldown-cmark](https://crates.io/crates/pulldown-cmark) | Markdown parser (some LSP servers return markdown) |
| [ratatui](https://crates.io/crates/ratatui) | Full-featured Text User Interfaces (TUI) library, very cool! |
| [syntect](https://crates.io/crates/syntect) | Syntax highlighting based on Sublime Text syntax definitions |
| [tree-sitter](https://crates.io/crates/tree-sitter) | Incrementally parsing concrete syntax trees for various languages (used in auto-indent & semantic highlighting) |

General purpose libraries:

| Crate | One-Line Summary |
| :--- | :--- |
| [anyhow](https://crates.io/crates/anyhow) | Makes it easy to align all your errors to a single type |
| [async-trait](https://crates.io/crates/async-trait) | Enables the use of `async` functions in Rust traits, which is currently unsupported natively |
| [chrono](https://crates.io/crates/chrono) | Date and time manipulation and formatting |
| [clap](https://crates.io/crates/clap) | command-line arguments parsing, auto-generated help messages, and more |
| [libc](https://crates.io/crates/libc) | Low-level bindings to OS-level C standard library |
| [libloading](https://crates.io/crates/libloading) | dlopen wrapper (used for libgpm dynamic loading) |
| [lru](https://crates.io/crates/lru) | Implements a simple, efficient Least Recently Used (LRU) cache based on a hash map and a linked list |
| [nix](https://crates.io/crates/nix) | Bindings to Unix-like OS APIs (e.g., processes, file descriptors) |
| [regex](https://crates.io/crates/regex) | Regular expression engine |
| [schemars](https://crates.io/crates/schemars) | Used for generating JSON Schema from Rust data structures for API validation and documentation (config.json autogenerated parser) |
| [serde](https://crates.io/crates/serde) | Serializing/deserializing data structures efficiently, including json (with sede_json) |
| [sha2](https://crates.io/crates/sha2) | SHA-256, SHA-512, etc. |
| [tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio) | Asynchronous runtime for concurrency (e.g. use it for async IO) |
| [tracing](https://crates.io/crates/tracing) | Tracing and structured logging (also using `tracing-subscriber`) |


Thanks to all these projects - and their maintainers :)
